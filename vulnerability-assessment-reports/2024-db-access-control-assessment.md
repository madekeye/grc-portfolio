📄 Vulnerability Assessment Report
Assessment Date: April 15, 2024
Assessment Period: January 2024 – March 2024
Framework Used: NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1

🖥️ System Description
The system under assessment is a high-performance Linux server equipped with a multi-core CPU and 128GB of RAM. It hosts a MySQL database management system and uses IPv4 networking for server-to-server communication. Security features include encrypted connections via SSL/TLS. The server is central to storing and managing customer, campaign, and analytics data for personalized marketing operations.

🎯 Assessment Scope
This vulnerability assessment focused specifically on the access control mechanisms governing the database server. It includes review of current configurations, access rights, user behaviors, and authentication protocols.

🎯 Purpose of the Assessment
The objective is to evaluate the system’s exposure to unauthorized access or misuse, particularly as it supports core marketing operations. Given the sensitivity of stored data and its contribution to business intelligence, securing access to this database is critical for operational integrity and regulatory compliance.

🔍 Assessment Methodology
Using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 risk analysis methodology, we:

Identified asset vulnerabilities related to database access

Mapped potential threat sources and related threat events

Evaluated likelihood and impact using qualitative scoring

Derived a composite risk score to guide remediation priorities

🛠️ Remediation Strategy
To reduce risk and improve access control posture, we recommend implementing the following:

Access Controls

Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to limit privileges

Require strong password policies and multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Regularly audit user roles and permissions

Encryption Enhancements

Replace deprecated SSL with TLS 1.2+ for secure data-in-transit encryption

Network Restrictions

Implement IP allow-listing to restrict access to corporate networks

Disable remote access by default unless explicitly required

Auditing and Monitoring

Enable database activity logging

Implement automated alerting for suspicious access attempts

📈 Outcomes (If Metrics Are Available)
If you’re presenting this after remediation efforts, consider adding metrics like:

✅ Reduced risk score from 9 to 4 by enforcing MFA and RBAC

🔐 100% of privileged users enrolled in MFA

📉 60% reduction in unauthorized login attempts in Q2 2024
