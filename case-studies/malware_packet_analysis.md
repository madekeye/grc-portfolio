# 🦠 Case Study: Malware Traffic Detection Using Wireshark

## 📘 Scenario Overview
This case study involves analyzing a `.pcap` file suspected to contain traffic generated by malware. The goal is to identify C2 (Command and Control) communication, unusual patterns, or known malicious IPs/domains.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Identify malicious domains or IPs
- Detect obfuscated or encrypted payloads
- Track persistence or beaconing behavior

## 🛠 Tools Used
| Tool        | Purpose                  |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Wireshark   | Deep packet inspection   |
| VirusTotal  | Domain/IP reputation     |
| Zeek (optional) | Log correlation       |

## 🧪 Investigation Tasks & Findings
- Detected repeated outbound connections to suspicious IPs
- Base64-encoded payloads found in HTTP POST requests
- DNS tunneling behavior suspected from long TXT queries

## 🔐 Security Insights
- Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) logged
- Communication to `example.evil.com` flagged as malicious

## 📁 Files Included
- `malware_traffic.pcap`
- `ioc_report.txt`
- `malware-packet-analysis.md`

## 📌 Lessons Learned
- Malware may use legitimate protocols for covert comms
- Payload inspection is key to identifying threats

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Threat hunting via PCAPs
- Malware C2 analysis
- Use of threat intel tools
